ughhh cordova problems
On iOS ensure the build setting "ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES" is set to "$(inherited)" for the main build target and all pods
some plugins are overriding this and it causes build failures
ensure the ./platforms/ios/Podfile has "use_frameworks!"
This is supposed to be set by a plugin after build hook, but that isn't consistently running
